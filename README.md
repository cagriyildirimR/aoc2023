# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions for the 2023 AoC, written in Go.

## Quick Setup
### Get your Advent of Code session token:

1. Log in at Advent of Code.
2. Find the SESSION cookie in your web browser's developer tools.
### Configure your environment:

1. Create a .env file in the project root.
2. Add `SESSION=your_session_token_here`, replacing with your token.
Now you can use the Input method.
